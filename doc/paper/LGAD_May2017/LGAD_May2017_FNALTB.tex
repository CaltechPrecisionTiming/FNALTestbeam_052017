%% Text of abstract
In this paper we report measurements of the uniformity of time resolution, signal
amplitude, and charged particle detection efficiency across the sensor surface
of low-gain avalanche detectors (LGAD). Comparisons of the performance of sensors
with different doping concentrations and different active thicknesses are
presented, as well as their temperature dependance and radiation tolerance up to
$6\times 10^{14}$~n/cm$^2$. Results were obtained at the Fermilab test beam
facility using 120 GeV proton beams, and a high precision pixel tracking
detector. LGAD sensors manufactured by the Centro Nacional de Microelectr\'{o}nica (CNM) and
Hamamatsu Photonics (HPK) were studied. The uniformity of the
sensor response in pulse height before irradiation was found to have a
2\% spread. The efficiency and timing  resolution before irradiation
were found to be 100\%  and 30-40~\si{ps}, respectively. A ``no-response'' area between pads was
measured to be about 70~$\mu$m for CNM and 110$\mu$m for HPK sensors. After a
neutron fluence of $6\times 10^{14}$~n/cm$^2$ the CNM sensor exhibits a large
gain variation of a factor of $2.5$ when comparing metallized and non-metallized
sensor areas. An irradiated CNM sensor achieved a time resolution of 30~ps for the
metallized area and 40~ps for the non-metallized area, while the HPK sensor 
achieved a 30~\si{ps} time resolution.

\section{Introduction} 

Future colliders, including the high luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron
Collider (HL-LHC) at CERN, will operate with an order of magnitude higher
instantaneous luminosity compared to what has been achieved at the
large hadron collider (LHC) so far.
With the increased instantaneous luminosity, the rate of simultaneous
interactions per bunch crossing (pileup) is projected to reach an average of 140
to 200. The large amount of pileup increases the likelihood of confusion in the
reconstruction of particles from the hard scattering interaction with those
produced in different pileup interactions. In particular, the ability to discriminate between
jets produced in the events of interests, especially those associated with vector boson fusion processes, and jets produced by pileup interactions will be
degraded. Additionally, the efficiency to identify high $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ isolated electrons
and muons will be severely reduced due to the high density of pileup particles
in their vicinity. The missing transverse energy resolution will also deteriorate, and several
other physics objects performance metrics will also suffer the
detrimental effects of pileup.


One way to mitigate the pileup effects mentioned above, complementary to precision
tracking methods, is to perform a time of arrival measurement associated with
each particle. Such a measurement with a precision of about 20-30~\si{ps}, will
reduce the effective amount of pileup by a factor of 10, given that the spread
in collision time of the pileup interactions at HL-LHC is foreseen to be
approximately 200~\si{ps}. We have previously shown that a precision of better than
$20$~\si{ps} can be achieved for electromagnetic showers measured with silicon
sampling calorimeters~\cite{Apresyan201662,Apresyan2017_NSSMIC,AKCHURIN201731}
using traditional planar silicon detectors. In this paper, we report results of
particle beam measurements with thin low-gain avalanche detectors (LGAD) that have
been shown to achieve time resolutions around 30~\si{ps}~\cite{Cartiglia201783}. LGAD
are envisioned to be used in the CMS and ATLAS experiment upgrades for HL-LHC in
order to reduce the pileup contamination. The implemented regions of
pseudorapidity ($\eta$) are:
$|\eta|>1.5$ and $|\eta|>3.0$ for CMS and ATLAS, respectively. In order to achieve
the desired timing precision across a large area of the detectors, the
sensors will need to provide high uniformity of signal response and timing
resolution. In this paper, we perform detailed measurements of the performance of
LGAD sensors produced by Centro Nacional de Microelectr\'{o}nica (CNM) and
Hamamatsu Photonics (HPK) exposed to the 120~GeV proton beam at Fermilab.
Utilizing high-precision tracking detectors we extract position dependence of
the charged-particle detection efficiency, signal pulse height, signal
timestamp, and time resolution. We also compare the performance of 
50 and 80~$\mu$m LGAD sensors, as well as the HPK and CNM sensors irradiated to 
an equivalent neutron flux of $6\times 10^{14}$~n/cm$^2$.

The paper is organized as follows: the experimental setup is described in
Sec.~\ref{sec:setup}; the tested LGAD sensors and their operating conditions are
listed in Sec.~\ref{sec:sensors}; readout electronics used in the measurements are 
described in Sec.~\ref{sec:boards}; beam test results are presented in 
Sec.~\ref{sec:results}, followed by the conclusion in Sec.~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{Experimental Setup} 
\label{sec:setup}

%We performed the test-beam measurements at the Fermilab Test-beam
%Facility%

Test-beam measurements were performed at the Fermilab Test-beam Facility (FTBF)
which provided a $120$~GeV proton beam from the Fermilab Main Injector
accelerator. The Devices Under Test (DUTs) were mounted on a remotely operated
motorized stage, placed inside the pixel telescope detector~\cite{KWAN2016162}.
The latter provides better than 10~$\mu$m position resolution for charged
particles impinging on the DUT. Additionally, a Photek~240 micro-channel plate
(MCP-PMT) detector~\cite{Anderson:2015gha, MCPFastCaloNIMA,
Ronzhin2015288,Ronzhin201552} was placed furthest downstream, and provided a
very precise reference timestamp. Its precision has been previously
measured to be less than $7$~ps~\cite{Ronzhin2015288}. A schematic diagram and
photograph of the experimental area are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:DragonBoxDiagram}
and Fig.~\ref{fig:DragonBox}, respectively. 

The DAQ system for the DUTs and the Photek MCP-PMT is based on a CAEN V1742
digitizer board~\cite{CAENDRS}, which provides digitized waveforms sampled at 5
GS/s, and with one ADC count corresponding to 0.25~mV. The CAEN digitizer was
voltage- and time-calibrated using the procedure described in
Ref.~\cite{Kim201467}. The electronic time resolution of the CAEN V1742
digitizer was measured to be less than 4~ps, and thus, its impact on the timing
measurements presented in these studies can be neglected. The DAQ for the pixel
telescope is based on the CAPTAN system developed at
Fermilab~\cite{KWAN2016162}. The track-reconstruction is performed using the
Monicelli software package developed specifically for the test-beam application. 

The beam is resonantly extracted in a slow spill for each Main Injector cycle
delivering a single 4.2 sec long spill per minute. The primary beam (bunched at
53 MHz) consists of high energy protons (120 GeV) at variable intensities
between 1 and 300 kHz. The trigger to both the CAEN V1742 and to the pixel
telescope was provided by a scintillator mounted on a photomultiplier tube,
placed upstream of the DUTs in the beam-line. Due to the limited buffer depth of
the CAEN V1742 board, special care had to be taken in the design of the DAQ
system to ensure that both the DUT and telescope DAQs collect exactly the same
amount of triggers. This was achieved by limiting the trigger rate by
introducing an adjustable dead-time using a custom-designed trigger board. This
trigger board is the combination of a custom FPGA board (the CAPTAN+x, equipped
with multiple FPGA Mezzanine Card connectors and gigabit ethernet connectivity)
mated to a front end board (the NIM+, with multiple inputs and outputs, each
supporting a variety of interface levels such as NIM, LVDS, and TTL). The
combined board is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:NIM+Captan} and was used to interface to
photomultiplier signals through on-board programmable discriminators, and to form
trigger signals with software configurable time-based veto and pre-scaler event
filtering. We found that at a rate of about 1,500 triggers per spill the CAEN
V1742 and pixel telescope maintained full synchronization. Processed data
from the pixel telescope and the DUTs were merged offline by matching the
trigger counters recorded by the two systems.

The DUTs were placed inside the telescope box described in
Ref.\cite{KWAN2016162}, and mounted on an aluminum mechanical support structure.
The telescope box can be moved remotely in both the horizontal and vertical
directions in order to align the DUTs with the beam. The aluminum support
structure for the DUTs provide both mechanical stability and are
equipped with Peltier cooling elements that were used in this study to operate
the DUTs at $-10^{\circ}$ and $-20^{\circ}$~C.

\section{LGAD Sensor Properties}
\label{sec:sensors}

Sensors manufactured by HPK and CNM were measured in the test beam
experiment. Both single- and four-channel configurations of the sensor were used
in the measurements. The sensors studied have active thicknesses of
about 50~$\mu$m and 80~$\mu$m. 

%The list of sensors studied in this
%article, as well as the temperature and the sensor bias voltage used during
%their operation are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:DataConditions}. 

CNM sensors have an active thickness of about 45~$\mu$m and were
produced on 4-inch Silicon-on-Insulator wafers with a 45~$\mu$m thick high
resistivity float zone (FZ) active layer on top of a 1~$\mu$m buried oxide and a
300~$\mu$m support wafer. The back-side contact is achieved through wet-etched deep
access holes through the insulator. Details on CNM sensors can be found in
Ref.~\cite{CNMSensors, Cartiglia201783}. 

The HPK sensors were manufactured on 6-inch silicon wafers of 150~$\mu$m total
thickness with a 50~$\mu$m or 80~$\mu$m thick high resistivity float zone (FZ)
active layer. Four gain splits, identified with the letters A (lowest gain) to D
(highest gain), were produced identical in the mask design but with a different
$p^+$ dose of the gain layer to study the optimal parameters of the charge
multiplication mechanism. The pads were produced in three versions: two with
guard ring (GR and GBGR) and one without guard ring. Four-channel sensors in a $2\times 2$
array were produced with all 4 gain-splits, and are identified with the PIX
identifier. For example, the $2\times 2$ array of the 50~$\mu$m sensor split D is labelled as
50D-PIX. The sensor corresponding to each of the four channels in the array 
is also referred to as a pixel in this paper. 
Each pixel in the $2\times 2$ HPK array has dimensions of $3\times 3$~$\mathrm{mm}^{2}$. 
The CNM single-channel sensors are square pads with an active area of $1.7$~$\mathrm{mm}^{2}$ 
while the HPK single-channel sensors are circular pads with an active area of $0.8$~$\mathrm{mm}^{2}$.

the micro-bonds that are connected to the signal pads on the sensors.

\section{Readout Electronics}
\label{sec:boards}

Three readout electronics boards were used in various measurements presented in this paper.
They were independently developed at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL),
at the University of Kansas (KU), and at the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC).

The 4-channel Fermilab LGAD test board is designed to test sensors up to 8.5~mm
by 8.5~mm at voltages up to 1~kV. Four wire-bonding pads allow for signal
readout via amplifiers based on Mini-Circuits GALI-66+. The amplifiers feature 
transformers with 1:2 input impedance matching, two stages of amplification and 
a 500~MHz low-pass filter. In this full configuration, the amplifiers feature
12.5~$\Omega$ input impedance, 5~k$\Omega$ transimpedance, 500~MHz bandwidth and
1~mV rms output noise. If needed it is possible to jump the input transformer 
and/or the low-pass filter, which would result in an input impedance of 50~$\Omega$,
transimpedance of 10~k$\Omega$, and bandwidth of 2~GHz.

The 2-channel KU board, designed and produced by the University of Kansas, can
accommodate many types of sensors including diamond, silicon, LGAD or avalanche photodiodes (APD). 
The sensor is hosted on the board itself and the electronics was optimized for precise 
timing measurements. In particular, the amplifier, made with discrete components, 
has an input impedance of 700~$\Omega$, an output noise of 4~mV and a gain in 
transresistance of about 50 mV/$\mu$A with a 3~dB bandwidth of 100~MHz. 
Those values were simulated for an input capacitance of 20~pF, 
which corresponds roughly to an LGAD of $9$~$\mathrm{mm}^{2}$. The power
consumption of the board is about 130~W per channel. 

The UCSC 1-channel board is described in detail in
Ref.~\cite{Cartiglia201783}. This board uses discrete components and contains
several features which allow for maintaining a wide bandwidth ($\sim$ 2 GHz) and a
low noise even in noisy environments. The inverting amplifier uses a high-speed
SiGe transistor which has a transimpedance of about 470~$\Omega$. A commercial
inverting amplifier with gain 10x is used to boost the signal. The 4-channel
UCSC board has two stages: the first one is identical to the UCSC single channel
board, and is followed by an inverting stage. The total transimpedance is 10.7
k$\Omega$.

\section{Sensor Studies and Analysis}
\label{sec:results}

We present a number of different studies performed on the LGAD sensors 
described in Section~\ref{sec:sensors}. They include signal response 
uniformity, gap distance between adjacent pixels, 
doping profile and sensor thickness characterization,
temperature and irradiation dependence, and timing resolution. A brief overview of the
analysis methods is given below, followed by subsections describing
the details and results of each study.

As discussed in Section~\ref{sec:setup}, the reference time
is measured using the Photek MCP-PMT detector. The timestamp
for this reference detector is obtained by fitting the 
peak region of the pulse to a Gaussian function and the
mean parameter of the Gaussian is assigned as the timestamp $t_0$. The timestamp for
signals from the LGAD sensors is obtained in two different ways depending on
which read-out board was used. For the KU board, which has a slower decay time,
the timestamp is obtained by by performing a linear fit to the
rising edge of the pulse and the time at which the pulse reaches 45\% of the
maximum amplitude is assigned as its timestamp $t_1$. For the FNAL and UCSC boards,
which have fast decay times, the timestamp is obtained via a fit to a 
Gaussian function analogous to what is done for the reference detector.

Events are required to have a signal in the Photek MCP-PMT consistent with a 
minimum ionizing particle (MIP), and a signal above the noise in LGAD sensors. 
The MIP signal selection in the Photek MCP-PMT is the same for all runs
and requires that the signal amplitude is between $160$~mV and $320$~mV.
The signal selection for LGAD boards was
optimized for each board individually, by selecting the MIP signal peak fitted
with a Landau function. All measurements other than those described in Sec.~\ref{sec:temp_dependance}
and ~\ref{sec:rad_tolerance} were performed at room temperature. 

Here, and in the remainder of this article, whenever a scan of a certain
characteristic quantity -- e.g. time resolution --  of the sensor is presented, we show the
X-axis scan for pixels 1 and 2, and the Y-axis scan for pixels 1 and 3, as
defined on the left picture in Fig.~\ref{fig:HPK_Sensors}. The X-axis scan
across pixels 3 and 4, and Y-axis scan across pixels 2 and 4 show
qualitatively the same features, and are not presented here. 


\subsection{Study of the uniformity of the LGAD sensors}
\label{sec:HPK_CNM_uniformity}

We present in detail uniformity studies -- including signal detection
efficiency, most probable value, time difference, and time resolution  -- accross the sensitive
area of the LGAD. The sensors under study were produced
by HPK and CNM. The largest dataset was collected for the 
HPK 50D-PIX sensor and the CNM W9HG11 sensor as they were the best
performing sensors from HPK and CNM respectively. The 
HPK 50D-PIX sensor was mounted on the 4-channel FNAL board and biased to $-300$~V, while the 
CNM W9HG11 sensor was mounted on the 4-channel UCSC board and biased to $-180$~V.
Both sensors were operated at the room temperature for these studies. 

The measurements of the particle detection efficiency are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:FNAL_HPK50_effXY}. Efficiency is defined as the ratio of events
that register a signal above the noise level in the LGAD sensor to those that
contain a track identified by the pixel telescope pointing at the LGAD sensor.
We observe a flat 100\% efficiency across the whole sensor area. The left edge
in the X-axis scan of pixel 1 on HPK 50D-PIX sensor in
Fig.~\ref{fig:FNAL_HPK50_effXY} is outside the acceptance of the pixel
telescope, hence the efficiency curve does not fully cover its surface. A clear
drop in efficiency is observed in the transition (``no-response'') region between the two pixels.
A more detaied study of the ``no-response'' region is given in Sec.~\ref{sec:HPK_50D_gap}.

\begin{figure}[htbp] 
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{figs/HPK50DVsCNM_Efficiency_vs_X.pdf}

\caption{Efficiency measurement across the X-axis (left) and Y-axes (right) of the HPK 50D-PIX sensor

along the X-axis, and pixels 1 and 3 along the Y-axis are shown.
The pixel numbering scheme is defined in Fig.~\ref{fig:HPK_Sensors}.} 
\label{fig:FNAL_HPK50_effXY} 
\end{figure} 


An important characteristic is the uniformity of the signal size
across the surface of the sensor, which directly impacts its timing performance. We use the signal amplitude as the metric to characterize the signal
size uniformity. The distribution of the LGAD signal amplitudes is fit to a
Landau distribution. The most probable value (MPV) parameter of the fitted
Landau distribution is plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:FNAL_HPK50_MPVXY}. 
A flat response with a uniform signal size is observed over the whole sensor area.

along the Y-axis are shown. The pixel numbering scheme is defined in Fig.~\ref{fig:HPK_Sensors}.} 
\label{fig:FNAL_HPK50_MPVXY} 
\end{figure} 


The measurements of the time difference $\Delta t = t_{1}-t_{0}$ between the
reference timestamp ($t_0$) and the timestamp of the LGAD sensors ($t_1$) are
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:FNAL_HPK50_DTXY}. The micro-bonding scheme of the HPK PIX
$2\times 2$ sensor arrays is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:HPK_Sensors}, and \textbf
{FIXME NEED to add CNM array image similar to HPK one}. For the HPK sensor,
the $\Delta t$ dependence on the hit position indicates a shift of 
about $20$--$30$~ps between the metalized area near the center of the array
(gray region of the top-left image in Fig.~\ref{fig:HPK_Sensors}) and the non-metalized area.
A possible explanation for this effect is a small difference in
the rise time of the pulses between the metallized and non-metallized areas. 
The results for the CNM sensor also show hints of this behavior, though the
larger statistical uncertainties make it less significant.

\label{fig:FNAL_HPK50_DTXY} 
\end{figure} 

The measurement of the time resolution across the sensor surface is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:FNAL_HPK50_SigmaTXY}. The distribution of $\Delta t$ between the timestamp
of the LGAD signal and the reference signal is fitted with a Gaussian function, and
the spread $\sigma$ of the fitted function is defined as
the time resolution. We observe a uniform time resolution around 40~ps across
the whole surface area for HPK, and around 55~ps for CNM sensors.

\subsection{Measurement of the ``no-response'' area between two neighboring pixels}
\label{sec:HPK_50D_gap}

In order to precisely measure the width of the no-response area between two
neighboring pixels, a large statistics sample of about 350,000 events was
collected with the HPK 50D-PIX sensor mounted on a 2-channel KU board. The sensor
was biased to $-300$~V. The large dataset allowed us to perform a
detailed scan in the area between the two pixels as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:FNAL_HPK50_ZoomeffXY}. In order to estimate the width of the
no-response between the pixels, the efficiency curves of the two neighboring
pixels are fitted with an S-curve function of the form $y=p_1\times
\mathrm{erf}\left\{\pm(p_2-x)/p_3)\right\}+p_4$, where $\mathrm{erf}$ is the error
function, and $p_i$ are floated in the fit. We define the width of the
``no-response'' area as the distance between the half-maxima of the two fitted
S-curves, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:FNAL_HPK50_ZoomeffXY}. We measure the width
of the no-response area on the HPK 50D-PIX sensor to be 110~$\mu$m, with an
uncertainty of 10~$\mu$m.

\label{fig:FNAL_HPK50_ZoomeffXY} 
\end{figure} 

A further measurement was made on the 4-channel UCSC board for the
HPK 50C-PIX sensor and the CNM W9HG11 sensor. 
We compare the width of the gap region of the HPK and CNM sensors in
Fig.~\ref{fig:UCSC_HPK50C_CNM_ZoomeffXY}. Both sensors in this
comparison were tested in the beam simultaneously. The HPK 50C-PIX sensor was operated 
at $-450$~V, and CNM W9HG11 sensor was operated at $-180$~V. We measure the
size of the ``no-response'' region to be around 110~$\mu$m on the HPK
50C-PIX -- compatible 
with the HPK 50D-PIX sensor -- and around 70~$\mu$m for the CNM sensor. Both
measurements have an uncertainty of 10~$\mu$m.

%\subsection{Comparison of the boards}
\subsection{Comparison of HPK doping profiles}

Studies of the dependence of the sensors' characteristics on the doping
concentrations were performed by comparing the 50~$\mu$m HPK PIX sensors of
different gain splits. In order to reduce the impact of the variations between
different readout boards, all measurements presented in this section were
performed using only 2-channel KU readout boards. Four readout boards were
prepared, each with an HPK sensor mounted on it, and tested in the beam. Data
taken with the HPK 50D-PIX is the same as that presented in
Fig.~\ref{fig:FNAL_HPK50_ZoomeffXY}, which is the largest data sample collected
during this test beam campaign. Therefore, the statistical uncertainties in the
measurements of the HPK 50A-, B-, and C-PIX sensors are larger than those of
50D-PIX. For this study, the sensors were operated at room temperature, and 
their bias voltages were set to $-630$~V, $-550$~V,$-400$~V, and $-300$~V
for the HPK 50A-PIX, HPK 50B-PIX, HPK 50C-PIX, and HPK 50D-PIX sensors, respectively.

% This discussion is very weak. need to reorganize the logic
The distribution of the MPV of signal amplitudes across the sensor area is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:KUBoard_50ABCD_MPV}, where the MPV is extracted as described in
Sec.~\ref{sec:HPK_CNM_uniformity}. Comparing the signal amplitudes between the
two pixels one observes that the gain varies between the two channels. However,
comparing the MPV distribution of the HPK 50D-PIX sensors shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:KUBoard_50ABCD_MPV} with the one shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:FNAL_HPK50_MPVXY}, it is clear that the observed difference in gain
among these two channels is not due to variations in the sensor
properties but rather imperfections in the reaout board.
The differences in the signal size between two channels on the KU board are
attributed to imperfections in the manufacturing process of the custom-designed
pre-amplifiers used in the boards. Nevertheless, signal MPV within a
single pixel is highly uniform
for all tested samples.

\label{fig:KUBoard_50ABCD_MPV} 
\end{figure} 

The measurements of the time difference between the reference timestamp and the timestamps of the HPK sensors are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:KUBoard_50ABCD_MeanTime}. As was shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:FNAL_HPK50_DTXY}, the $\Delta t$ exhibits an offset of about $20$~ps 
between the metalized area and the non-metalized area of the sensor. 
The feature is present in all 4 types of the HPK PIX sensors and appear to be 
statistically consistent in shape and magnitude.

for the difference in resolution on two pixels of A and C. I suspect this is due

\subsection{Comparison of HPK 50 $\mu$m with 80 $\mu$m}
\label{sec:HPK50vs80}

The thickness of the active area of the sensor is an important design parameter
when optimizing for time resolution. A thicker sensor will result in a larger
signal size and will generally improve the time resolution. However, a thicker
sensor also increases the size of Landau fluctuations which will tend to
degrade the time resolution. Therefore, it is an interesting study to understand
whether increasing the sensor thickness -- from $50$~$\mu$m to
$80$~$\mu$m -- 
will have any impact on the measured time resolution. 

This study is performed using the HPK C-PIX sensors with the same dopant concentration.
The $80$~$\mu$m sensor HPK 80C-PIX is biased at $-610$~V, while the $50$~$\mu$m sensor 
HPK 50C-PIX is biased at $-400$~V. The time resolution for the two sensors are shown
in Fig.~\ref{fig:HPK50CVs80C} as a function of position, and exhibit fairly uniform 
behavior. The measured time resolutions range from $40$~ps to $50$~ps and 
are relatively similar for these two different sensor
thicknesses.\textbf{WHAT READOUT BOARD DID WE USE HERE?}

\subsection{Temperature dependence of the LGAD sensors}
\label{sec:temp_dependance}

In order to maintain their optimal performance at the highest fluences
envisioned at the HL-LHC, the LGAD sensors will be cooled to temperatures below
$-20^{\circ}$C degrees. Operation at such low temperatures will allow to
significantly reduce the leakage current, and additionally improve the timing
characteristics of the sensors. In this section we describe the measurements of
the LGAD sensors performed at $-10$ and $-20^{\circ}$C degrees, and compare the
results to those at room temperature. These measurements were performed with
the HPK 50D-PIX sensors mounted on the FNAL 4-channel board. The sensor was
biased at the same voltage of $-250$~V for all temperature scenarios.

The distribution of the signal MPV across the sensor surface is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:MPV_vs_X_HPK50D_TemperatureDependance}. We observe that the signal
MPV increases by more than a factor of two when the temperature is reduced 
from $+20^{\circ}$C to $-20^{\circ}$C. While the MPV uniformity across the two
channels are within 2\% of each other at room temperature, at lower temperatures 
one of the pixels shows a difference of about 5\% with respect to its neighboring pixel.
A more detailed study is needed to understand whether this difference is due to
non-uniform temperature distribution across the sensor array or due to differences 
in the signal response between different pixel sensors at colder temperatures.

\label{fig:MPV_vs_X_HPK50D_TemperatureDependance} 
\end{figure} 

The distribution of the $\Delta t$ between the reference timestamp and the timestamp
from the HPK 50D-PIX sensor is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:MeanTime_vs_X_HPK50D_TemperatureDependance}. We observe no
significant changes in the behavior of the $\Delta t$ as the temperature varies.

\label{fig:MeanTime_vs_X_HPK50D_TemperatureDependance} 
\end{figure} 

The time resolution measured for the HPK 50D-PIX sensor is
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:TimeResolution_vs_X_HPK50D_TemperatureDependance}. 
We observe a significant improvement in the time resolution as
the temperature is lowered from $+20^{\circ}$C to $-20^{\circ}$C degrees.
As the temperature is lowered, the signal-to-noise ratio improves as 
the gain of the LGAD sensor increases and the electronics noise decreases. 
The noise was observed to remain relatively constant at 1.2~mV for both $+20$ and
$-20^{\circ}$C. Therefore the improvement comes mainly from the increase in the 
signal gain. The time resolution was measured to
improve from around 55-60~ps at the room temperature, down to 35-40~ps at
$-20^{\circ}$C.

\subsection{Radiation tolerance of the LGADs}
\label{sec:rad_tolerance}

In this section we present the studies of the irradiated HPK and CNM sensors,
which were exposed to neutron irradiation at the Ljubljana TRIGA reactor. The
neutron spectrum and flux are well known and the fluence is quoted in 1 MeV
equivalent neutrons per cm$^2$ (n$_{\mathrm{eq.}}$/cm$^2$ or 
n/cm$^2$ for short). After $6\times 10^{14}$~n/cm$^2$ irradiation, the devices were
annealed for 80 min at $60^{\circ}$C. Afterward the devices were kept at
$-20^{\circ}$C degree during storage, transportation, and test beam experiments.

The two-dimensional distribution of the signal amplitudes on the surface of the
irradiated sensors are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:CNM_irradiated_amp_Map} and
\ref{fig:HPK_irradiated_amp_Map}. From the comparison with the image of the CNM
sensor shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:HPK_Sensors} and the distribution in
Fig.~\ref{fig:CNM_irradiated_amp_Map}, it is clear that two distinct regions can
be identified on the sensor based on the signal amplitude: the region under the
aluminum metallization on the periphery of the sensor, and the region without
aluminum metallization in the center. The distribution on the right of
Fig.~\ref{fig:CNM_irradiated_amp_Map} shows that the amplitude under the
aluminum (periphery) is about 2.5 times larger than that without
aluminum (center). The amplitude scan
of the irradiated HPK 50D sensor is shown on the left panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:HPK_irradiated_amp_Map}, and a uniform amplitude across the
sensor surface is observed, which can also be seen on the right panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:HPK_irradiated_amp_Map}. In contrast to the CNM sensor, the HPK
sensor does not contain any portions that have active area covered with
aluminum metallization.

Measurements of the particle detection efficiency are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:IrradiatedSensorStudy_Efficiency}. These measurements were
performed with the HPK sensor biased at $-600$~V, and the CNM sensor biased at
$-400$~V. We observe a flat 100\% efficiency across the whole HPK sensor area, and
the efficiency of the CNM sensor is also very close to 100\%. As with the
pixelated array sensors, a clear drop in efficiency is observed near the edges
of the active area.

The distribution of MPV of signal amplitudes across the sensor area is shown in

two bias voltage values for both sensors: $-600$ and $-635$~V for HPK, and
$-400$ and $-420$~V for CNM sensors. \textbf{FIXME HARTMUT what are the gains at
these voltage values?}. A uniform signal amplitude is observed across the HPK
sensor, while for the CNM sensor the amplitude varies across the sensor surface,
as observed also in Fig.~\ref{fig:CNM_irradiated_amp_Map}. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\label{fig:IrradiatedSensorStudy_MPV} 
\end{figure}

The distribution of the $\Delta{t}$ between the reference timestamp and the
timestamps of the signals from the irradiated HPK and CNM sensors are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:IrradiatedSensorStudy_MeanTime}. Measurements at both bias voltage
values are presented. We measured a uniform distribution of the $\Delta{t}$
values across the HPK sensor. The CNM sensor exhibits a non-uniformity across
the sensor surface, where the signals from the central, non-metallized area
arrive are about 10~ps faster than those from the peripheral, metalized area.
\textbf {This behavior is opposite of that observed in the non-irradiated
sensors, both CNM and HPK. However, given that the signals in the non-metallized
area of the irradiated CNM sensor are much larger than those in the periphery,
this behavior is expected, since the gain in this region is larger (is it?).}

\label{fig:IrradiatedSensorStudy_MeanTime} 
\end{figure} 

Distributions of the time resolution across the surface of the irradiated
sensors are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:IrradiatedSensorStudy_TimeResolution}. The time
resolution measured with the HPK sensor improves slightly with the increase of
the bias voltage, and shows a uniform distribution across the sensor surface. In
contrast, the CNM sensor shows a non-uniform distribution of time resolution,
which is a consequence of the variations of the signal amplitude across the
sensor. We do not observe an improvement in the time resolution measured with
the CNM sensor with the increase in the bias voltage.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion} 

In a beam test at FNAL with tracking information, we compared the performance of
LGAD produced by CNM Barcelona and HPK Hamamatsu. Single pads of diameter 1~mm
and $2\times 2$ arrays of square pixels of 3~mm were used. Sensors with
thicknesses of about 50 and 80 $\mu$m were studied. Four different readout boards 
were used, and their performance characteristics are to be discussed in detail 
in an upcoming paper~\cite{}. The uniformity of the
sensor response in pulse height, efficiency, and timing resolution
were studied.
 The uniformity of the
sensor response in pulse height before irradiation was found to have a
2\% spread. The efficiency and timing  resolution before irradiation
were found to be 100\%  and 30-40~\si{ps}, respectively. The
``non-response'' region between pixels was measured to be about 70~$\mu$m for CNM sensors and 110~$\mu$m for HPK sensors. 
A small timing shift across the HPK sensor of the order 20--30~\si{ps'} can
be explained by the observed change in pulse shape when comparing metallized and
non-metallized sensor areas. Uniform signal detection efficiency of 100\% is
observed on all sensors, both before and after irradiation. 

For an un-irradiated 50~$\mu$m thick LGADs with 3~mm pads we find the following timing results: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item at a temperature of $+20^{\circ}$C, the timing resolution ranges from
        40~ps to 50~ps depending on the readout board. %This number worsens by
        %10~ps for a 80~$\mu$m sensor.
        %This last statement is not true
  \item cooling the LGAD, while keeping the bias voltage the same at $-250$~V
        (\textbf {what is the gain at $-250$~V}),
        improves the timing resolution from 55~ps at $+20^{\circ}$C to 43~ps at
        $-10^{\circ}$C to 36 ps at $-20^{\circ}$C. \end{itemize}

After a neutron fluence of $6\times 10^{14}$~n/cm$^2$, the single pad CNM sensor
exhibits a large gain variation of a factor 2.5 when comparing metallized and
non-metallized sensor areas. For an 50~$\mu$m thick LGAD with 1~mm pads
irradiated $6\times 10^{14}$~n/cm$^2$ we find the following timing results when
operated at $-20^{\circ}$C: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item for the HPK LGAD the highest bias voltage reached is $-635$~V
    and the corresponding timing resolution is 30~ps; 
  \item for the CNM LGAD the highest bias voltage reached is $-420$~V
    and the corresponding
        timing resolution is 30~ps for the metallized area and $40$~ps for the
        non-metallized area.
