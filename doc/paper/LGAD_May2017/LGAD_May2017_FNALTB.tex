%% Text of abstract
The high luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) at CERN is
expected to provide instantaneous luminosities of $5\times 10^{34}$ cm$^{-2}$
s$^{-1}$. The high luminosities expected at the HL-LHC will be accompanied by a
factor of $5$ to $10$ more pileup compared with LHC conditions in $2015$,
further increasing the challenge for particle identification and event
reconstruction. Precision timing allows to extend calorimetric measurements into
such a high density environment by subtracting the energy deposits from pileup
interactions. Calorimeters employing silicon as the active component have
recently become a viable choice for the HL-LHC and future collider experiments
which face very high radiation environments. In this article, we present studies
of basic calorimetric and precision timing measurements using a prototype
composed of tungsten absorber and silicon sensor as the active medium. We show
that for the bulk of electromagnetic showers induced by electrons in the range
of $20$~GeV to $30$~GeV, we can achieve time resolutions better than $25$~ps per
single pad sensor.

\section{Introduction} 

\section{Test-beam Setup} 

We performed the test-beam measurements at the Fermilab Test-beam Facility
(FTBF) which provided a proton beam from the Fermilab Main Injector accelerator
at $120$~GeV. The Devices Under Test (DUT) were mounted on a remotely operated
motorized stage, placed inside the pixel telescope detector~\cite{KWAN2016162}
which provides better than 10~$\mu$m position resolution for the particles
impinging on the DUT. Finally, a Photek 240 micro-channel plate photomultiplier
detector~\cite{Anderson:2015gha, MCPFastCaloNIMA, Ronzhin2015288,Ronzhin201552}
is placed furthest downstream, and serves to provide a very precise reference
timestamp. Its precision was previously measured to be less than
$10$~psec~\cite{Ronzhin2015288}. A photograph of the experimental area is shown
in Fig.~\ref{fig:DragonBox}. 

The DAQ system for the DUTs and the Photek MCP-PMT is based on a CAEN V1742
digitizer board~\cite{CAENDRS}, which provides digitized waveforms sampled at 5
GS/s, and one ADC count corresponds to 0.25~mV. The CAEN digitizer is voltage-
and time-calibrated using the procedure described in Ref.~\cite{Kim201467}. The
electronic time resolution of the CAEN V1742 digitizer was measured to be
$\sim$4~ps, and its impact on the timing measurements presented in this studies
can be neglected. The DAQ for the pixel telescope is based on the CAPTAN system
developed at Fermilab~\cite{KWAN2016162}. The track-reconstruction is performed
using the Monicelli software package developed specifically for the testbeam
application. 

The beam is resonantly extracted in a slow spill for each Main Injector cycle
delivering a single 4.2 sec long spill per minute. The primary beam (bunched at
53 MHz) consists of high energy protons (120 GeV) at variable intensities
between 1 and 300 kHz. The trigger to both the CAEN V1742 and to the pixel
telescope was provided by a scintillator mounted on a photomultiplier tube,
placed upstream of the DUTs in the beam-line. Due to the limited buffer depth of
the CAEN V1742 board, special care had to be taken in the design of the DAQ
system to ensure that both the DUT and telescope DAQs collect exactly the same
amount of triggers. This was achieved by limiting the trigger rate by
introducting an adjustable dead-time using a custom-designed FPGA board. We
found that at a rate of about 1,500 triggers per spill the CAEN V1742 and pixel
telescope were maintained fully synchronized. Processed data from the pixel
telescope and the DUTs were merged offline by matching the trigger counters
recorded by the two systems.

\end{figure} 

The devices under test (DUT) were placed inside the telescope box described in
Ref.\cite{KWAN2016162}, and mounted on aluminum mechanical support structure.
The telescope box can be moved remotely in both horizontal and vertical
directions, in order to align the DUTs with the beam. The aluminum support
structures for DUT provide both a mechanical stability for the DUTs, and are
equipped with Peltier cooling elements that were used in this study to operate
the DUTs at $-10^{\circ}$ and $-20^{\circ}$~C.

\section{Properties of the tested LGAD sensors}

Sensors manufactured by Hamamatsu (HPK) and CNM were tested during the test beam
experiments. All sensors have active thickness of about 50 $\mu$m. 

{\bf FIXME NICOLO OR HARTMUT: FILL IN DETAILS OF CNM AND HPK SENSORS, PRODUCTION
PROCESS ETC} Details on CNM sensors can be found in Ref.~\cite{CNMSensors,
Cartiglia201783}. Hamamatsu sensors have the following properties... 

Sensors in both single- and four-channel configurations were tested during the
measurements. The CNM single-channel sensors had an active area of 1 mm$^2$ {\bf
FIXME: IS THIS CORRECT SIZE OF CNM SINGLE CHANNEL SENSORS?}, and the HPK
single-channel sensors had a diameter of 1~mm. The dimensions of the four
channel sensors from HPK are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Sensors}

\section{Read-out boards}

Four boards were used in various measurements presented in this paper, which
were developed at the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC), University of
Kansas (KU), and at FNAL:

\begin{itemize}
  \item A single-channel USCS board that
was also used in results presented in Ref.~\cite{Cartiglia201783}
\item A four-channel USCS readout board
\item A two-channel KU readout board
\item A 4-channel FNAL readout board.
\end{itemize}

and their detailed description is presented below.  

\textbf {FIXME SERGEY} a paragraph describing the FNAL board. 

\textbf {FIXME NICOLA} a paragraph describing the 2-ch KU board. 

The USCS board 1-channel board is desdcibed in details in Ref.~\cite{Cartiglia201783}. This board uses discrete components and contains several features which allow maintaining a wide bandwidth ($\sim$ 2 GHz) and a low noise even in noisy environments. The inverting amplifier uses a high-speed SiGe transistor whcih has a trans-impedance of about 470~$\Omega$. 

\textbf {FIXME HARTMUT} a paragraph describing the 4-ch UCSC board. 


\section{Beam test results}

\subsection{Analysis procedure}

The CAEN digitizer is voltage and time calibrated using the procedure described
in Ref.~\cite{Kim201467}. The time for the reference Photek MCP-PMT detector is
obtained by fitting the peak region of the pulse to a Gaussian function and the
mean parameter of the Gaussian is assigned as the timestamp $t_0$. The time for
signals from the LGAD sensors is obtained by performing a linear fit to the
rising edge of the pulse and the time at which the pulse reaches 30\% of the
maximum amplitude is assigned as its timestamp $t1$ \textbf{FIXME DESCRIBE THE
ALGORITHMS FOR LGADS}. We measured the electronic time resolution of the CAEN
V1742 digitizer as $\sim$4~ps and neglected its impact on the timing
measurements described below. 

Events are required to have a signal in the Photek MCP-PMT consistent with a MIP
signal, and a signal above the noise in LGAD sensors. The MIP signal selection
in Photek MCP-PMT is the same for all runs, since it was always read out
directly by the CAEN digitizer. The signal selection for LGAD boards was
optimized for each board individually, by selecting the MIP signal peak fitted
with a Landau function.
