In this paper we report measurements of uniformity of time resolution, signal
amplitude, and charged particle detection efficiency across the sensor surface
of low-gain avalanche detectors (LGAD). Comparisons of performance of sensors
with different doping concentrations, and different active thicknesses are
presented, as well as their temperature dependance and radiation tolerance up to
$6\times 10^{14}$~n/cm$^2$. Results were obtained at the Fermilab test beam
facility using 120 GeV proton beams, and a high precision pixel tracking
detector. LGAD sensors based on the Low-Gain Avalanche Detector (LGAD) design
were manufactured by the the Centro Nacional de Microelectr\`onica (CNM) and
Hamamatsu Photonics (HPK) were tested in the experiments. The uniformity of the
sensor response in pulse height, efficiency and timing resolution were found to
be good pre-radiation, with time resolution around 30-40~ps depending on
operating conditions. A ``no-response'' area between pads which exhibit was
measured to be around 70~$\mu$m for CNM and 110$\mu$m for HPK sensors. After a
neutron fluence of $6\times 10^{14}$~n/cm$^2$ the CNM sensor exhibits a large
gain variation of a factor 2.5 when comparing metallized and non-metallized
sensor areas. Irradiated CNM sensor achieved time resolution of 30~ps for the
metallized part, and 40~ps for the non-metallized area, while the time
resolution of the HPK sensor was measured to be 30~ps.

\section{Introduction} 

Future colliders, including the high luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron
Collider (HL-LHC) at CERN, will operate with an order of magnitude higher
instantaneous luminosity compared to what has been achieved at the LHC so far.
With the increased instantaneous luminosity the rate of simultaneous
interactions per bunch crossing (pileup) is projected to reach an average of 140
to 200. The large amount of pileup increases the likelihood of confusion in the
reconstruction of particles from the hard scatter interaction with those
produced in different pileup interactions. The ability to discriminate between
jets produced in the events of interests, especially those associated with the
vector boson fusion processes, and jets produced by pileup interactions will be
degraded. The efficiency of identifying high $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ isolated electrons
and muons will be severely reduced due to the high density of pileup particles
in their vicinity. The missing transverse energy resolution will deteriorate, and several
other physics objects performance metrics will suffer.

One way to mitigate the pileup confusion effects, complementary to precision
tracking methods, is to perform a time of arrival measurement associated with
each particle. Such a measurement with a precision of about 20-30~ps, will
reduce the effective amount of pileup by a factor of 10, given that the spread
in collision time of the pileup interactions at HL-LHC is foreseen to be
approximately 200~ps. We have previously shown that a precision of better than
$20$~ps can be achieved for electromagnetic showers measured with silicon
sampling calorimeters~\cite{Apresyan201662,Apresyan2017_NSSMIC,AKCHURIN201731}
using traditional planar silicon detectors. In this paper we report results of
beam test measurements with thin low-gain avalanche detectors (LGAD) that have
been shown to achieve time resolution around 30~ps~\cite{Cartiglia201783}. LGAD
are envisioned to be used in the CMS and ATLAS experiment upgrades for HL-LHC in
order to reduce the pileup contamination in the region of pseudorapidity beyond
$\eta>1.5$ for CMS, and $\eta>3.0$ for ATLAS. In order to satisfy the needs of a
high precision timing across a large area of the detectors for HL-LHC, the
sensors will need to be provide high uniformity of signal response and timing
resolution. In this paper we perform detailed measurements of the performance of
LGAD sensors from CNM and HPK exposed to the 120~GeV proton beams at Fermilab.
Utilizing the high precision tracking detector we extract position dependence of
the timing resolution, signal pulse height, signal time stamp, and charged
particle detection efficiency, as well as we compare the 50 and 80~$\mu$m LGAD
sensors, and the performance of the HPK and CNM sensors irradiated to $6\times
10^{14}$~n/cm$^2$.

The paper is organized as follows: the experimental setup is described in
Sec.~\ref{sec:setup}, the tested LGAD sensors and their operating conditions are
listed in Sec.~\ref{sec:sensors}, readout boards used in the measurements are described in Sec.~\ref{sec:boards}, beam test results are presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:results}, followed by the conclusion in Sec.~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{Test-beam Setup} 
\label{sec:setup}

%We performed the test-beam measurements at the Fermilab Test-beam
%Facility%

Test-beam measurements were performed at the Fermilab Test-beam Facility (FTBF)
which provided a $120$~GeV proton beam from the Fermilab Main Injector
accelerator. The Devices Under Test (DUTs) were mounted on a remotely operated
motorized stage, placed inside the pixel telescope detector~\cite{KWAN2016162}.
The latter provides better than 10~$\mu$m position resolution for charged
particles impinging on the DUT. Additionally, a Photek~240 micro-channel plate
(MCP-PMT) detector~\cite{Anderson:2015gha, MCPFastCaloNIMA,
Ronzhin2015288,Ronzhin201552} was placed furthest downstream, and provided a
very precise reference timestamp. Its precision has been previously
measured to be less than $10$~ps~\cite{Ronzhin2015288}. A schematic diagram and
photograph of the experimental area are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:DragonBoxDiagram}
and Fig.~\ref{fig:DragonBox}, respectively. 

The DAQ system for the DUTs and the Photek MCP-PMT is based on a CAEN V1742
digitizer board~\cite{CAENDRS}, which provides digitized waveforms sampled at 5
GS/s, and with one ADC count corresponding to 0.25~mV. The CAEN digitizer was
voltage- and time-calibrated using the procedure described in
Ref.~\cite{Kim201467}. The electronic time resolution of the CAEN V1742
digitizer was measured to be less than 4~ps, and thus, its impact on the timing
measurements presented in these studies can be neglected. The DAQ for the pixel
telescope is based on the CAPTAN system developed at
Fermilab~\cite{KWAN2016162}. The track-reconstruction is performed using the
Monicelli software package developed specifically for the test-beam application. 

The beam is resonantly extracted in a slow spill for each Main Injector cycle
delivering a single 4.2 sec long spill per minute. The primary beam (bunched at
53 MHz) consists of high energy protons (120 GeV) at variable intensities
between 1 and 300 kHz. The trigger to both the CAEN V1742 and to the pixel
telescope was provided by a scintillator mounted on a photomultiplier tube,
placed upstream of the DUTs in the beam-line. Due to the limited buffer depth of
the CAEN V1742 board, special care had to be taken in the design of the DAQ
system to ensure that both the DUT and telescope DAQs collect exactly the same
amount of triggers. This was achieved by limiting the trigger rate by
introducing an adjustable dead-time using a custom-designed trigger board. This
trigger board is the combination of a custom FPGA board (the CAPTAN+x, equipped
with multiple FPGA Mezzanine Card connectors and gigabit ethernet connectivity)
mated to a front end board (the NIM+, with multiple inputs and outputs, each
supporting a variety of interface levels such as NIM, LVDS, and TTL). The
combined board is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:NIM+Captan} and was used to interface to
photomultiplier signals through on-board programmable discriminators, and to form
trigger signals with software configurable time-based veto and pre-scaler event
filtering. We found that at a rate of about 1,500 triggers per spill the CAEN
V1742 and pixel telescope were maintained fully synchronized. Processed data
from the pixel telescope and the DUTs were merged offline by matching the
trigger counters recorded by the two systems.

The devices under test (DUT) were placed inside the telescope box described in
Ref.\cite{KWAN2016162}, and mounted on aluminum mechanical support structure.
The telescope box can be moved remotely in both horizontal and vertical
directions, in order to align the DUTs with the beam. The aluminum support
structures for DUT provide both a mechanical stability for the DUTs, and are
equipped with Peltier cooling elements that were used in this study to operate
the DUTs at $-10^{\circ}$ and $-20^{\circ}$~C.

\section{Properties of the tested LGAD sensors}
\label{sec:sensors}

Sensors manufactured by Hamamatsu (HPK) and CNM were tested during the test beam
experiments. Sensors in both single- and four-channel configurations were tested
during the measurements. Most of the tested sensors have active thickness of
about 50 $\mu$m, apart from the comparison of the 50 and 80 $\mu$m sensors that
is presented in Sec.~\ref{sec:HPK50vs80}. The list of sensors studied in this
article, as well as the temperature and the sensor bias voltage used during
their operation are listed in Tab.~\ref{tab:DataConditions}. 

CNM sensors have active thickness of about 45 $\mu$m, they were
produced on 4-inch Silicon-on-Insulator wafers with a 45 $\mu$m thick high
resistivity float zone (FZ) active layer on top of a 1 $\mu$m buried oxide and a
300 $\mu$m support wafer. The back-side contact is done through wet-etched deep
access holes through the insulator. Details on CNM sensors can be found in
Ref.~\cite{CNMSensors, Cartiglia201783}. 

The HPK sensors were manufactured on 6-inch silicon wafers of 150 $\mu$m total
thickness with a 50 $\mu$m or 80 $\mu$m thick high resistivity float zone (FZ)
active layer. Four gain splits, identified with the letters A (lowest gain) to D
(highest gain), were produced, identical in the mask design but with a different
$p^+$ dose of the gain layer, to study the optimum parameters of the charge
multiplication mechanism. The pads were produced in three versions: two with
guard ring (GR and GBGR) and one without guard ring. Four-channel sensors in 2x2
array were produced with all 4 gain-splits, and are identified with the PIX
identifier, e.g. the 2x2 array of the 50 $\mu$m sensor split D is labelled as
50D-PIX. 

Each channel in the 2x2 HPK array is 3x3~mm$^2$. The CNM single-channel sensors
are square pads with an active area of 1.7 mm$^2$ while the HPK single-channel
sensors are circular pads with an active area of 0.8~mm$^2$.

Signals from the pixels are read out by the micro-bonds that are connected to the signal pads on the sensors. \textbf {FIXME better quality images for CNM sensors} }

\end{figure} 


\section{Read-out boards}
\label{sec:boards}

Three boards were used in various measurements presented in this paper, which
were developed at the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC), University of
Kansas (KU), and at FNAL:

The 4-channel Fermilab LGAD test board is designed to test sensors up to 8.5~mm
by 8.5~mm at voltages up to 1~kV. Four wire-bonding pads for allow for signal
readout via Mini-Circuits GALI-66+ based amplifiers. Amplifiers feature 1:2
input impedance matching transformers, two stages of amplification and a 500~MHz
low-pass filter. In this full configuration, the amplifiers feature
12.5~$\Omega$ input impedance, 5~k$\Omega$ transimpedance, 500~MHz bandwidth and
1~mV rms output noise. If needed the input transformer and/or low-pass filter
can be jumped changing the input impedance to 50~$\Omega$ (transimpedance to
10~k$\Omega$) and bandwidth to 2~GHz.

The 2-channel KU board, designed and produced by the University of Kansas, can
accommodate different types of sensors, i.e. diamond, silicon, LGAD or APDs. The
sensor is hosted on the board itself and the electronics of the version used for
this work was optimized for precise timing measurements. In particular, the
amplifier, made with discrete components, has an input impedance of 700 Ohm, an
output noise of 4 mV and a gain in transresistance of about 50 mV/$\mu$A with
a 3 dB bandwidth of 100 MHz. Those values were simulated for an input
capacitance of 20 pF, which corresponds roughly to a LGAD of 9 mm$^2$. The power
consumption of the board is about 130 mW per channel. Similar electronics is
available in different configurations with 1, 2 (used in this work) or 8
channels.

The USCS board 1-channel board is described in details in
Ref.~\cite{Cartiglia201783}. This board uses discrete components and contains
several features which allow maintaining a wide bandwidth ($\sim$ 2 GHz) and a
low noise even in noisy environments. The inverting amplifier uses a high-speed
SiGe transistor which has a trans-impedance of about 470~$\Omega$. A commercial
inverting amplifier with gain 10x is used to boost the signal. The 4-channel
UCSC board has two stages: the first one is identical to the UCSC single channel
board, and is followed by an inverting stage. The total trans-impedance is 10.7
k$\Omega$.

\section{Beam test results}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Analysis procedure}

The CAEN digitizer is voltage and time calibrated using the procedure described
in Ref.~\cite{Kim201467}. The time for the reference Photek MCP-PMT detector is
obtained by fitting the peak region of the pulse to a Gaussian function and the
mean parameter of the Gaussian is assigned as the timestamp $t_0$. The time for
signals from the LGAD sensors is obtained by performing a linear fit to the
rising edge of the pulse and the time at which the pulse reaches 45\% of the
maximum amplitude is assigned as its timestamp $t1$. We measured the electronic
time resolution of the CAEN V1742 digitizer as $\sim$4~ps and neglected its
impact on the timing measurements described below. 

Events are required to have a signal in the Photek MCP-PMT consistent with a MIP
signal, and a signal above the noise in LGAD sensors. The MIP signal selection
in Photek MCP-PMT is the same for all runs, since it was always read out
directly by the CAEN digitizer. The signal selection for LGAD boards was
optimized for each board individually, by selecting the MIP signal peak fitted
with a Landau function. 

All measurements other than those described in Sec.~\ref{sec:temp_dependance}
and ~\ref{sec:rad_tolerance} were performed at room temperature. 

Here, and in the remainder of this article, whenever a scan of a certain
characteristic quantity (e.g. time resolution) sensors is presented, we show the
X-axis scan for pixels 1 and 2, and the Y-axis scan for pixels 1 and 3, as
defined on the left picture in Fig.~\ref{fig:HPK_Sensors}. The X-axis scan
across pixels 3 and 4, and Y-axis scans across pixels 2 and 4 shown
qualitatively the same features, and are not shown here. 


\subsection{Measurement of the ``no-response'' area between two neighboring pixels}
\label{sec:HPK_50D_gap}

In order to precisely measure the width of the no-response area between two
neighboring pixels, a large statistics sample of about 350,000 events was
collected with the HPK 50D-PIX sensor mounted on a 2-channel KU board, and the
bias voltage set to $-300$~V. Such a large data sample allowed us to perform a
detailed scan in the area between the two pixels as shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:FNAL_HPK50_ZoomeffXY}. In order to estimate the width of the
no-response between the pixels, the efficiency curves of the two neighboring
pixels are fitted with an S-curve function of the form $y=p_1\times
\mathrm{erf}\left\{\pm(p_2-x)/p_3)\right\}+p_4$, where $\mathrm{erf}$ is the error
function, and $p_i$ are floated in the fit. We define the width of the
``no-response'' area as the distance between the half-maxima of the two fitted
S-curves, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:FNAL_HPK50_ZoomeffXY}. We measure the width
of the no-response area on the HPK 50D-PIX sensor to be 110~$\mu$m, with an
uncertainty of 10~$\mu$m.

\begin{figure}[!htbp] 
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{figs/KUBoard_HPK50DPix_Run638-781/Eff_vs_X_HPK50DPIX_Ch1_2_fit.pdf} 
\caption{A zoomed version of the efficiency measurement across the X-axis of the HPK 50D-PIX sensor operated at $-300$ V bias voltage. Pixel numbering scheme is defined in Fig.~\ref{fig:HPK_Sensors}.} 
\label{fig:FNAL_HPK50_ZoomeffXY} 
\end{figure} 

We compare the width of the no-response area of the CNM and HPK sensors in
Fig.~\ref{fig:UCSC_HPK50C_CNM_ZoomeffXY}. Both sensors in this comparison were
mounted on 4-channel UCSC boards, and both boards were tested in the beam
simultaneously. The HPK 50C-PIX sensor was operated at $-450$~V, and CNM W9HG11
sensor at $-180$~V. While the statistics in this data sample is significantly
lower than that shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:FNAL_HPK50_ZoomeffXY}, we measure the
no-response width to be around 110~$\mu$m on the HPK 50C-PIX, which is
compatible with the HPK 50D-PIX sensor. The measurement of the no-response width
of the CNM sensor yields around 70~$\mu$m. Measurements of both HPK 50C-PIX and
CNM W9HG11 have an uncertainty of 10~$\mu$m.

The red curves are fitted to the data points as described in the text. Arrows indicate the distance between half-maximum points of fitted curves.}

\subsection{Study of the uniformity of the LGAD sensors}
\label{sec:HPK_CNM_uniformity}

We studied the response uniformity of the HPK 50D-PIX sensor mounted on the
4-channel FNAL board, and CNM CNM W9HG11 mounted on the 4-channel UCSC board.
The HPK sensor was biased to $-300$~V, and CNM sensor was biased to $-180$~V. Both
sensors were operated at the room temperature.

The measurements of the particle detection efficiency are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:FNAL_HPK50_effXY}. Efficiency is defined as the ratio of events
that register a signal above the noise level in the LGAD sensor to those that
contain a track identified by the pixel telescope pointing at the LGAD sensor.
We observe a flat 100\% efficiency across the whole sensor area. The left edge
in the X-axis scan of pixel 1 on HPK 50D-PIX sensor in
Fig.~\ref{fig:FNAL_HPK50_effXY} is outside the acceptance of the pixel
telescope, hence the efficiency curve does not fully cover its surface. A clear
drop in efficiency is observed in the transition region between the two pixels,
and the width of the no-response area is studied in detail in
Sec.~\ref{sec:HPK_50D_gap}.

\begin{figure}[htbp] 
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{figs/HPK50DVsCNM_Efficiency_vs_X.pdf}

\caption{Efficiency measurement across the X-axis (left) and Y-axes (right) of the HPK 50D-PIX sensor mounted on the FNAL board, and the CNM W9HG11 on UCSC board. The scan of pixels 1 and 2 along the X-axis, and pixels 1 and 3 along the Y-axis is shown, and pixel numbering scheme is defined in Fig.~\ref{fig:HPK_Sensors}.} 
\label{fig:FNAL_HPK50_effXY} 
\end{figure} 


An important characteristic of the sensors is the uniformity of the signal size
across the sensor surface, which directly impacts the timing characteristics of
the sensor. We use the signal amplitude as the metric to characterize the signal
size uniformity. The distribution of the LGAD signal amplitudes is fit with a
Landau distribution. The post-fit Most Probable Value (MPV) is plotted in
Fig.~\ref{fig:FNAL_HPK50_MPVXY}. A flat response with a uniform signal size is
observed over the whole sensor area.

The measurement of the time difference $\Delta t = t_{1}-t_{0}$ between the
Photek 240 MCP-PMT time stamp ($t_0$), and that of the LGAD sensors ($t_1$) is
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:FNAL_HPK50_DTXY}. The micro-bonding scheme of the HPK PIX
$2\times 2$ sensors arrays is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:HPK_Sensors}, and \textbf
{FIXME NEED to add CNM array image similar to HPK one}. The $\Delta t$
distribution on the HPK sensor has a distinct shape where the area under the
metallization on top of the sensor -- the gray area in the center of the image
-- shows a shift of about $20$--$30$~ps with respect to non-metallized area. A
possible explanation for this small effect is an observed slight difference in
the rise time of pulse from the metallized and un-metallized areas. \textbf
{Both HPK and CNM sensors exhibit a behavior where signals originating in the
metallized areas arrive earlier than those in the non-metallized areas. This is
probably due to the field in the gain region under the metallization being
higher. }

sensor and the Photek 240 MCP-PMT sensor is fitted with a Gaussian function, and
the spread $\sigma$ of the fitted function is referred to in the following as
the time resolution. We observe a uniform time resolution around 40~ps across
the whole surface area for HPK, and around 55~ps for CNM sensors.

%\subsection{Comparison of the boards}


\subsection{Comparison of HPK doping profiles}

Studies of the dependence of the sensors' characteristics on the doping
concentrations were performed by comparing the 50~$\mu$m HPK PIX sensors of
different gain splits. In order to reduce the impact of the variations between
different readout boards, all measurements presented in this section were
performed using only 2-channel KU readout boards. Four readout boards were
prepared, each with an HPK sensor mounted on it, and tested in the beam. Data
taken with the HPK 50D-PIX is the same as that presented in
Fig.~\ref{fig:FNAL_HPK50_ZoomeffXY}, which is the largest data sample collected
during this test beam campaign. Therefore, the statistical uncertainties in the
measurements of the HPK 50A-, B-, and C-PIX sensors are larger than those of
50D-PIX. In the studies presented in this section sensors were operated at the
room temperature, and their bias voltages were set to the following values: HPK
50A-PIX was operated at $-630$~V, 50B-PIX at $-550$~V, HPK 50C-PIX at $-400$~V, and
50D-PIX at $-300$~V. 

The distribution of MPV of signal amplitudes across the sensor area is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:KUBoard_50ABCD_MPV}, where the MPV is extracted as described in
Sec.~\ref{sec:HPK_CNM_uniformity}. Comparing the signal amplitudes between the
two pixels one observes that the gain varies between the two channels. However,
comparing the MPV distribution of the HPK 50D-PIX sensors shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:KUBoard_50ABCD_MPV} with the one shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:FNAL_HPK50_MPVXY} it is clear that the difference in the gain
observed in these two channels are not due to the variations in the sensor gain.
These differences in the signal size between two channels on the KU board are
attributed to imperfections in the manufacturing process of the custom-designed
pre-amplifiers used in these boards. Signal MPV within a pixel is highly uniform
for all tested samples.

\label{fig:KUBoard_50ABCD_MPV} 
\end{figure} 

The measurement of the time difference between the Photek 240 MCP-PMT time
stamp, and that of the HPK sensors is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:KUBoard_50ABCD_MeanTime}. As was shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:FNAL_HPK50_DTXY}, the $\Delta t$ distribution has a distinct shape
where the area under the metallization shows a shift of about $20$--$30$~ps with
respect to non-metallized area. The feature is present in all 4 types of the HPK
PIX sensors, and within the available statistics the features appear to have
consistent shape and magnitude.

\label{fig:KUBoard_50ABCD_MeanTime}

The measurements of the time resolution across the sensors is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:KUBoard_50ABCD_TimeResolution}. We observe a uniform time
resolution around 40~ps across the whole sensor area. \textbf {FIXME explanation
for the difference in resolution on two pixels of A and C. I suspect this is due
to difference in gain in two pre-amps on KU board}.

\subsection{Comparison of HPK 50 $\mu$m with 80 $\mu$m}
\label{sec:HPK50vs80}

The comparison between the 50 and 80 $\mu$m HPK sensors in terms of their time
resolution uniformity is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:HPK50CVs80C}. We compared two
HPK sensors with the same dopant concentration from the C-PIX series: HPK
50C-PIX and HPK 80C-PIX. The HPK 80C-PIX sensor was operated at $-610$~V bias
voltage. The distribution shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:HPK50CVs80C} is the same as
that shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:KUBoard_50ABCD_TimeResolution}. The comparison of
the 50 and 80~$\mu$m sensors shows a similar level uniformity of time resolution
across the sensor area, and we measure around $40$~ps with the $50~\mu$m
sensors, and around $50$~ps with the $80~\mu$m sensors.

\subsection{Temperature dependence of the LGAD sensors}
\label{sec:temp_dependance}

In order to maintain their optimal performance at the highest fluences
envisioned at the HL-LHC, the LGAD sensors will be cooled to temperatures below
$-20^{\circ}$C degrees. Operation at such low temperatures will allow to
significantly reduce the leakage current, and additionally improve the timing
characteristics of the sensors. In this section we describe the measurements of
the LGAD sensors performed at $-10$ and $-20^{\circ}$C degrees, and compare the
results to those at the room temperature. These measurements were performed with
the HPK 50D-PIX sensors mounted on the FNAL 4-channel board. In order to
maintain all operating conditions the same, and only change the sensor
temperature, the sensor was biased at $-250$~V in these measurements. 

The distribution of the signal MPV across the sensor surface is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:MPV_vs_X_HPK50D_TemperatureDependance}. We observe that the signal
MPV more than doubles when the temperature is reduced from $+20^{\circ}$C to
$-20^{\circ}$C. While the MPV distributions at room temperature across the two
channels are within 2\% of each other, at lower temperatures one of the pixels
shows about 5\% difference of the MPV with respect to its neighbor.

\label{fig:MPV_vs_X_HPK50D_TemperatureDependance}

The distribution of the $\Delta t$ between the Photek 240 MCP-PMT and the HPK
50D-PIX sensor is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:MeanTime_vs_X_HPK50D_TemperatureDependance}. We observe no
significant changes in the behavior of the $\Delta t$ as the temperature varies.

The distribution of the time resolution measured with the HPK 50D-PIX sensor is
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:TimeResolution_vs_X_HPK50D_TemperatureDependance}. The
measured noise was observed to stay constant at 1.2~mV for both $+20$ and
$-20^{\circ}$C. We observe a significant improvement in the time resolution as
the temperature is lowered from $+20^{\circ}$C to $-20^{\circ}$C degrees, due to
the improved signal-to-noise ratio. Time resolution measured was measured to
improve from around 55-60~ps at the room temperature, down to 35-40~ps at
$-20^{\circ}$C.

\subsection{Radiation tolerance of the LGADs}
\label{sec:rad_tolerance}

In this section we present the studies of the irradiated HPK and CNM sensors,
which were exposed to neutron irradiation at the Ljubljana TRIGA reactor. The
neutron spectrum and flux are well known and the fluence is quoted in 1 MeV
equivalent neutrons per cm$^2$ (n$_{\mathrm{eq.}}$/cm$^2$ or shortened
n/cm$^2$). After $6\times 10^{14}$~n/cm$^2$ irradiation, the devices were
annealed for 80 min at $60^{\circ}$C. Afterward the devices were kept in
$-20^{\circ}$C degree during storage, transportation, and test beam experiments.

The two-dimensional distribution of the signal amplitudes on the surface of the
irradiated sensors are shown in Figs.~\ref{fig:CNM_irradiated_amp_Map} and
\ref{fig:HPK_irradiated_amp_Map}. From the comparison with the image of the CNM
sensor shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:HPK_Sensors} and the distribution in
Fig.~\ref{fig:CNM_irradiated_amp_Map}, it is clear that two distinct regions can
be identified on the sensor based on the signal amplitude: the region under the
aluminum metallization on the periphery of the sensor, and the region without
aluminum metallization in the center. The distribution on the right of
Fig.~\ref{fig:CNM_irradiated_amp_Map} shows that the amplitude under the
aluminum is about 2.5 times larger than that in the center. The amplitude scan
of the irradiated HPK 50D sensor is shown on the left in
Fig.~\ref{fig:HPK_irradiated_amp_Map}, and a uniform amplitude across the
sensor surface is observed, which can also be seen on the right of
Fig.~\ref{fig:HPK_irradiated_amp_Map}. In contrast to the CNM sensor, the HPK
sensor does not contain any portions that have active area covered with
metallization.

Measurements of the particle detection efficiency are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:IrradiatedSensorStudy_Efficiency}. These measurements were
performed with the HPK sensor biased at $-600$~V, and the CNM sensor biased at
$-400$~V. We observe a flat 100\% efficiency across the whole HPK sensor area, and
the efficiency of the CNM sensor is also very close to 100\%. As with the
pixelated array sensors, a clear drop in efficiency is observed near the edges
of the active area. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]

The distribution of MPV of signal amplitudes across the sensor area is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:IrradiatedSensorStudy_MPV}, where the MPV is extracted as
described in Sec.~\ref{sec:HPK_CNM_uniformity}. Меаsurements were performed at
two bias voltage values for both sensors: $-600$ and $-635$~V for HPK, and
$-400$ and $-420$~V for CNM sensors. \textbf{FIXME HARTMUT what are the gains at
these voltage values?}. A uniform signal amplitude is observed across the HPK
sensor, while for the CNM sensor the amplitude varies across the sensor surface,
as observed also in Fig.~\ref{fig:CNM_irradiated_amp_Map}. 

\begin{figure}[htbp]

\label{fig:IrradiatedSensorStudy_MPV} 
\end{figure}

The distribution of the $\Delta{t}$ between the Photek 240 MCP-PMT and the
irradiated HPK and CNM sensors are shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:IrradiatedSensorStudy_MeanTime}. Measurements at both bias voltage
values are presented. We measured a uniform distribution of the $\Delta{t}$
values across the HPK sensor. The CNM sensor exhibits a non-uniformity across
the sensor surface, where the signals from the central, non-metallized area
arrive are about 10~ps faster than those from the peripheral, metalized area.
\textbf {This behavior is opposite of that observed in the non-irradiated
sensors, both CNM and HPK. However, given that the signals in the non-metallized
area of the irradiated CNM sensor are much larger than those in the periphery,
this behavior is expected, since the gain in this region is larger (is it?).}

\label{fig:IrradiatedSensorStudy_MeanTime} 
\end{figure} 

Distributions of the time resolution across the surface of the irradiated
sensors are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:IrradiatedSensorStudy_TimeResolution}. Time
resolution measured with the HPK sensor slightly improves with the increase of
the bias voltage, and shows a uniform distribution across the sensor surface. In
contrast, the CNM sensor shows a non-uniform distribution of time resolution,
which is a consequence of the variations of the signal amplitude across the
sensor. We do not observe an improvement in the time resolution measured with
the CNM sensor with the increase in the bias voltage.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion} 

In a beam test at FNAL with tracking information, we compared the performance of
LGAD produced by CNM Barcelona and HPK Hamamatsu, both single pads and 2x2
arrays with pad size varying from 1 mm to 3 mm diameter and a thickness of about
50 and 80 $\mu$m. Four different readout boards were used, and their performance
characteristics will be detailed in an upcoming paper. The uniformity of the
sensor response in pulse height, efficiency and timing resolution were tested
and found to be good pre-radiation with the exceptions of the area between pads
which exhibit a ``no-response'' width of about 70~$\mu$m for CNM and 110~$\mu$m
for HPK. A small timing shift across the HPK sensor of the order 20--30~ps can
be explained by the observed change in pulse shape when comparing metallized and
non-metallized sensor areas. Uniform signal detection efficiency of 100\% is
observed on all sensors, both before and after irradiation. 

For an un-irradiated 50~$\mu$m thick LGADs with 3~mm pads we find the following timing results: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item at a temperature of $+20^{\circ}$C, the timing resolution ranges from
        40~ps to 50~ps depending on the readout board. This number worsens by
        10~ps for a 80~$\mu$m sensor.
  \item cooling the LGAD, while keeping the bias voltage the same at $-250$~V
        (\textbf {what is the gain at $-250$~V}),
        improves the timing resolution from 55~ps at $+20^{\circ}$C to 43~ps at
        $-10^{\circ}$C to 36 ps at $-20^{\circ}$C. \end{itemize}

After a neutron fluence of $6\times 10^{14}$~n/cm$^2$, the single pad CNM sensor
exhibits a large gain variation of a factor 2.5 when comparing metallized and
non-metallized sensor areas. For an 50~$\mu$m thick LGAD with 1~mm pads
irradiated $6\times 10^{14}$~n/cm$^2$ we find the following timing results when
operated at $-20^{\circ}$C: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item for the HPK LGAD the highest bias voltage reached is $-635$~V and the timing resolution is 30~ps; 
  \item for the CNM LGAD the highest bias voltage reached is $-420$~V and the
        timing resolution is 30~ps for the metallized part and $40$~ps for the
        non-metallized area.
